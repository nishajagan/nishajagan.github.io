DATA VISUALIZATION PROJECT (US Flight Delays and Cancellations)

In this project, you’ll build interactive dashboards with Tableau and use them to discover and communicate insights from data. You’ll use a dataset of flight delays in the US to visualize the quality of airlines and airports, find the best times to fly, and more. 

Skills: Tableau



Insight (Dashboard) 1

This dashboard (Monthly Delays) consists of three worksheets – Monthly Average Delays, Percentage of Cancelled Flights and Percentage of Diverted Flights. Each of these worksheets are using the filter ‘Month’. This dashboard gives us an overview of which airline has the most delays on a monthly basis.

•	In the month of June, Spirit Airlines has the most average delay (Average Arrival Delay: 36.83 , Average Departure Delay: 37.39) of a total of 497 flights.
•	In the month June, American Eagle Airlines, has the most percentage of flights diverted (0.76% or 10 diverted flights)
•	In the month of June, Spirit Airlines, has the most percentage of flights cancelled (4.63% or 23 cancelled flights)

This dashboard(Delays by Airlines) consists of three worksheets – Reasons for Cancellations, Average Delays by Airlines and Total Delays by Month. Each of these worksheets are using the filter ‘Airline. This dashboard gives us an overview of which airline has the most delays based on the airlines.

•	For Alaska Airlines, the only reasons for cancellation are Airline (13 flights cancelled) and Weather (9 flights cancelled).
•	For Alaska Airline, the average delay is mostly due to late aircraft delay (16.96) and the least is due to security (0.34)
•	For Alaska Airlines, we can see that the total delay is cause by late aircraft delay and is the most in the month of January (2599) and the least in April (852)


Insight (Worksheet) 3

This worksheet (Weekly Percentage of  Diverted Flights by Month) gives us an overview of the number of flights diverted each week in a month. The number of flights diverted is the least in the month of September (0% - 4%) and the most in the month of February (0% - 26%) for the week of Monday.
