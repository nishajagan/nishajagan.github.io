**DATA VISUALIZATION PROJECT (US Flight Delays and Cancellations)**


**Project Description**

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.


**Flight Delays and Cancellations**

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.


You are required to create three visualizations. Some questions you may attempt to answer include those pertaining to the following areas:


1. Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?

	Determine which destinations and arrival destinations have the most delays? Doing this using maps is actually pretty difficult, but you may choose an alternative visual to provide this information. Think about what kind of aggregates might work best to determine which airlines and airports are the best and worst in terms of delays.

2. What causes delays?

	Think about if you work at an airline and you want to decrease delays. What part of the flight causes the most delays? Do these causes vary by airport or time of year?

You can also come up with your own question!

As you work with the data, come up with a question you're curious about and can be answered from the data. Build a dashboard or story to answer your question and lead viewers to that answer.

**Insight (Dashboard) 1**

[https://public.tableau.com/profile/nisha4435#!/vizhome/BuildDataDashboards_15584148431290/MonthlyDelays?publish=yes]

This dashboard (Monthly Delays) consists of three worksheets – Monthly Average Delays, Percentage of Cancelled Flights and Percentage of Diverted Flights. Each of these worksheets are using the filter ‘Month’. This dashboard gives us an overview of which airline has the most delays on a monthly basis.

* In the month of June, Spirit Airlines has the most average delay (Average Arrival Delay: 36.83 , Average Departure Delay: 37.39) of a total of 497 flights.

* In the month June, American Eagle Airlines, has the most percentage of flights diverted (0.76% or 10 diverted flights)

* In the month of June, Spirit Airlines, has the most percentage of flights cancelled (4.63% or 23 cancelled flights)

**Insight (Dashboard) 2**

This dashboard(Delays by Airlines) consists of three worksheets – Reasons for Cancellations, Average Delays by Airlines and Total Delays by Month. Each of these worksheets are using the filter ‘Airline. This dashboard gives us an overview of which airline has the most delays based on the airlines.

* For Alaska Airlines, the only reasons for cancellation are Airline (13 flights cancelled) and Weather (9 flights cancelled).

* For Alaska Airline, the average delay is mostly due to late aircraft delay (16.96) and the least is due to security (0.34)

* For Alaska Airlines, we can see that the total delay is cause by late aircraft delay and is the most in the month of January (2599) and the least in April (852)

**Insight (Worksheet) 3**

[https://public.tableau.com/profile/nisha4435#!/vizhome/BuildDataDashboards_15584148431290/WeeklyPercentageofDivertedFlightsbyMonth?publish=yes]

This worksheet (Weekly Percentage of  Diverted Flights by Month) gives us an overview of the number of flights diverted each week in a month. The number of flights diverted is the least in the month of September (0% - 4%) and the most in the month of February (0% - 26%) for the week of Monday.
